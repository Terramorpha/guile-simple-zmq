** Requirements

Guile-Simple-ZMQ requires the following to be installed:

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] >= 2.0.11
- [[https://zeromq.org/][ZMQ]]

** Installation

Guile-Simple-ZMQ uses GNU autotools to create the build and installation
scripts. The default install location is in `/usr/local`. From a
release tarball you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

This will install Guile-Simple-ZMQ with the prefix `/usr/local/`. This
might not be the default load path for your GNU Guile. You may choose
to change the prefix to your GNU Guile's location with `./configure
--prefix=/usr` or add `/usr/local/` to GNU Guile's load path in your
`.profile` or `.bash_profile` like this (replacing 2.2 with your GNU
Guile major version):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export GUILE_LOAD_PATH="/usr/local/share/guile/site/2.2${GUILE_LOAD_PATH:+:}$GUILE_LOAD_PATH"
export GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH="/usr/local/lib/guile/2.2/site-ccache${GUILE_LOAD_COMPILED_PATH:+:}$GUILE_COMPILED_LOAD_PATH"
#+END_SRC

A common issue you may encounter when installing, especially on Ubuntu
and Fedora, is guild not being found when you run `configure`. This
happens because the configure script finds a symbolic link to a
version of guile with a version number, like guile-2.2. This then has
the configure script check for guild-2.2 which does not exist. To fix
this, you can provide the path to the version of guile you want to
install it for.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./configure GUILE=$(which guile)
#+END_SRC

** Contributing

The easiest way to start hacking on Guile-Simple-ZMQ is to install [[https://gnu.org/s/guix][GNU Guix]]
and run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guix environment guile-simple-zmq
#+END_SRC

To build from git:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./bootstrap
./configure
make
#+END_SRC

To run the unit tests:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make check
#+END_SRC

You can then:

- Create a pull request on github
- Send a patch to one of the maintainers

And don't forget to add a unit test!

** Example
A server waits for a client message and answers to it. They are being executed
in parallel in the two different Jupyter Notebooks sessions.
